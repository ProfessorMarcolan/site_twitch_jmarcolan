  text:  Polimorfismo é a ferramenta da programação orientada ao objeto que permite implementações elegantes de software. Porém, muito mais importante que isso é que essa ferramenta permite, caso seja necessário, que o software seja facilmente modificado. Nesse post, de 5 minutos, vamos explorar definir o que é polimorfismo em Python e exemplificar o uso do polimorfismo. [10]

3.10.1 Function Scope and Hoisting
In some C-like programming languages, each block of code within curly braces has its
own scope, and variables are not visible outside of the block in which they are declared.
This is called block scope, and JavaScript does not have it. Instead, JavaScript uses
3.10 Variable Scope | 53
Core JavaScript
function scope: variables are visible within the function in which they are defined and
within any functions that are nested within that function.
In the following code, the variables i, j, and k are declared in different spots, but all
have the same scope—all three are defined throughout the body of the function:
function test(o) {
 var i = 0; // i is defined throughout function
 if (typeof o == "object") {
 var j = 0; // j is defined everywhere, not just block
 for(var k=0; k < 10; k++) { // k is defined everywhere, not just loop
 console.log(k); // print numbers 0 through 9
 }
 console.log(k); // k is still defined: prints 10
 }
 console.log(j); // j is defined, but may not be initialized
}
JavaScript’s function scope means that all variables declared within a function are visible throughout the body of the function. Curiously, this means that variables are even
visible before they are declared. This feature of JavaScript is informally known as hoisting: JavaScript code behaves as if all variable declarations in a function (but not any
associated assignments) are “hoisted” to the top of the function. Consider the following
code:

var scope = "global";
function f() {
 console.log(scope); // Prints "undefined", not "global"
 var scope = "local"; // Variable initialized here, but defined everywhere
 console.log(scope); // Prints "local"
}
